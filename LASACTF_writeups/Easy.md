####Problem
Find the flag in this file. You are given a file (easy.exe)


####Solution
I'd never tackled any interrogation of an exe file before, however, I wanted to give it a try. I'd used the `strings` command previously and thought I'd just run it here. 

Download the file and open Terminal. Type strings easy.exe and you'll find the plain test flag underneath KERNEL32.dll

Flag - {th1s_fl4g_i5_3asy}
