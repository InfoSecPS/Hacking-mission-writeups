####Problem
We intercepted these images QR1.png & QR2.png, but we don't know how they go together! Figure out the hidden message.


####Solution
I love using Photoshop so I lobbed these 2 PNG files into Photoshop to see what I could find. I layered them on top of each other and played around with the opacity of the layers and I revealed a QR code from the scrambled images. Scanned the QR code with my phone and the flag was revealed. 

Flag - {QR_c0d35_ar3_n3at}
