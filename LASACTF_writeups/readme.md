#LASACTF 2016 Write Ups

I signed up to this High School level CTF purely for some practice at time based challenges. I was quitely surprised at the level of challenges and the mix of difficulties in the wide range on offer. 

Sadly the CTF didn't run very long before it was hacked and quite a considerable amount of information was leaked to the public. All flags were posted to an IRC channel and the CTF was suspended, however, I managed 8 solves before it was closed down. 

When it went down I was 181st in the unranked scoreboard. Shame it never came back up but I was pretty proud of my achievements. 

Learned a lot
