#Ping Sweeper 
##BASH Script

I wanted to learn BASH scripting, however, much like all programming/scripting languages, you need an idea or a problem before you can use coding to solve it. My problem was that I need an idea to then learn the script. A bit of a conundrum. 

I use nmap a lot. I knew that I wanted to automate an nmap script via a user input of an IP address or range, however, I thought it was only possible in Python. I've tried a few things in BASH before to automate updating tasks, so I thought I'd give this a try. 

After digging around looking for a start, I went to work and wrote the script 

pingsweep.sh
