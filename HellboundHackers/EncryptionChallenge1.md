#Encryption Challenge 1

####Background
You are given a link to click and a box to enter some data. 

####Solution
Clicking the link opens a black web page with a binary string `010000100110100101101110011000010111001001111001001000000100100101110100011100110010000001000100011010010110011101101001011101000110000101101100011010010110001101101001011011110111010101110011` This looks dramatic, however, with a multitude of websites offering instant conversion, it's worth using this service. The converted binary strings works out as `Binary Its Digitalicious`. If you have time, and don't know how to convert binary to ASCII or Decimal, it's going to make things a lot easier if you understand it. It's quite interesting to know how to work it out. 

On to the next Challenge!!
