#Javascript Mission 1

####Background
I don't know any Javascript, however, I do like to read it. It's quite a logical language to read and often gives the game away with the flow of the code. In this challenge your just met with a login form prompt. No other information given. 


####Solution
Like many web application challenges it starts with `View Source`. Viewing the source throws you a lifeline in this challenge. When in the View Source code screen you want to be looking for the `<script>` tags. There's a section on Line 91 that needs your attention. The code snippet reveals the username and password. `Username: partyhard2` & `Password: lifeisshort1`. If you can follow the logical flow of the code it will make sense to you. 

Now for the next challenge!
